I developed this for updating json configs primarily.
Works with pattern expressions that are put inside {} that can be used to update configs.
All patterns can use the # symbol, which represents the 1-indexed position of the config in the sorted directory.

Command requires the format
    magic_update <dir> <update_1> <update_2> ... <update_n>

Update strings require the format
    <key>:<value_pattern>

If the key doesn't exist, the update will create it.
Special updates can be used to update things besides json key/value pairs.
As of writing this, the only special update is for re-naming files as follows
    FILENAME:<filename_pattern>
